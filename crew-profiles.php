		<p>Jenny likes snow skiing, listening to bluesy rock, and eating cheese and crackers. She even does them separately sometimes. After graduating from Providence (RI) College with a B.S. in Marketing, she naturally worked for a large ad agency focusing on clients in pharmaceuticals. Eventually she made her way to OM where she now manages accounts and makes sure everybody finds the time to laugh at least once a day.</p>

		<p>Allison misses the days when MTV just played videos. She puts hot sauce on just about everything from fajitas to her morning Cheerios. Based on those two criteria you probably already guessed she graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in journalism and mass communication. After college, she tried everything from marketing to marketing, finally ending up in marketing. She&rsquo;s already gotten her quarter-life crisis out of the way (the low point: dancing on stage with &rsquo;NSync) so she&rsquo;s pretty much a star on the rise. Her mantra is, &rdquo;If you&rsquo;re going to do it, do it right.&ldquo; Unless you&rsquo;re talking about making a left.</p>

		<p>Lee came to work for Obviouslee Marketing in 2005 because, as she says, &rdquo;How can you not work for a company that has your name in the title?&ldquo; Wait, what? Oh, she founded it? Ah. That makes WAY more sense. So she&rsquo;s the founder. Who just so happens to also be a huge fan of Parliament. Sadly we&rsquo;re not talking about the band. Or even the cigarettes. Yep, she&rsquo;s into British government. But other than that she&rsquo;s a pretty normal gal.</p>

		<h2>Marketing Strategist | Brand Architect | Project Shepherd</h2>

		<p>Ashley got her feet wet in the PR world at Hooper Communications (they had a pipe burst one day and the entire first floor flooded so she had to wade to her desk and it was a huge mess and â€¦ you know what, nevermind, long story). In 2010 the Winthrop grad joined OM and was entrusted with some of the firm&rsquo;s biggest clients. On the weekends, in an effort to keep her mind clear and calm, she likes to achieve namaste through yoga. By which we mean high gravity beer.</p>

		<h2>Communication Strategist | PR First Responder | Avid Researcher</h2>
		<h3><span>E:</span> <a href="">arielle@obviouslee.com</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>P:</span> 843.972.0712&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>X:</span> 15</h3>
		<p>Need a boost of confidence? Talk to Arielle. She laughs at everything. (Unless you tell her somebody died. Provided they didn&rsquo;t die in some sort of humorous way.) Arielle grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia. Yes, people actually live there. And no, they don&rsquo;t all churn butter and wear bonnets. (Only 90 percent do.) Before coming to OM she studied abroad in Rome and taught school in the Dominican Republic. Today she manages accounts for the team and spends her free time trying to convince her dad she&rsquo;s innocent.</p>

		<p>Mary clearly doesn&rsquo;t worry about trying to fit in because she&rsquo;s from the south and doesn&rsquo;t like country music. In her 28 plus years as a bookkeeper, she&rsquo;s worked for people who make surfboards, cigars, art, and boutique tents (don&rsquo;t ask). Besides liking numbers, she is nothing like the kind of bookkeeper you have in your head. Case in point: At 17 she got married just so she could go see the Rolling Stones in Florida. (Her parents wouldn&rsquo;t let her travel with her boyfriend unless she was married, so she thought it only made sense to tie the knot and catch Jagger and Richards in person.) Today, a mere 36 years later, she&rsquo;s still happily married.</p>
